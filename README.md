# Mario Pipe

## Why?

One day, after playing Super Mario Bros for a bit, i started reading Linus Ã…kesson's "[The TTY demystified](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/)" (go read it, it's cool). In a certain point of the article, i saw the word "pipe".

## How to use

You can run it normally:

```shell
$ cargo run
```

Or, you can **pipe** it:

```shell
$ cargo run | cat
```

## Did i waste 10 minutes doing this?

Yes, i did.
